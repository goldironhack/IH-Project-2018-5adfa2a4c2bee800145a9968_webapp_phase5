## Description of the datasets and function design

Rigth now I'm using only 'NY Districts geoshapes' (https://services5.arcgis.com/GfwWNkhOj9bNBqoJ/arcgis/rest/services/nycd/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1=1&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=geojson) to print the different districts in the map.

## Brief

My project consists in not only a nice looking, but also efficient webpage in the task of find the best place to live in NYC, according to the customer requests (School,University,Work,etc).
