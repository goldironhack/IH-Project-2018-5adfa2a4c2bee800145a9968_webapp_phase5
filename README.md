## Description of the datasets and function design

Rigth now I'm using only 'NY Districts geoshapes' (https://services5.arcgis.com/GfwWNkhOj9bNBqoJ/arcgis/rest/services/nycd/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1=1&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=geojson) to print the different districts en the map. 

## Brief

My project consists in not only a nice looking, but also efficient webpage in the task of find the best place to live in NYC, according to the custumer requests (School,University,Work,etc).

### Map View

ii. Y   Poligons that trace the districts

### Data Visualization

### Interaction Form

### Test Case
Tested and working on Google Chrome Version 64.0.3282.186 (Official Build) (64-bit) 

### Additional Info

I just expect to implement all datasets. Later, improve the front end of the site and start working on functionalities like map interaction and data visualization.
